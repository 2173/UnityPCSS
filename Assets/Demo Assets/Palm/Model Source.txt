Palm Tree models are from a royalty free model pack by killst4r, available on Turbosquid: https://www.turbosquid.com/FullPreview/Index.cfm/ID/490485
They are included for demonstration purposes only; I picked them only because they were free, fairly nice looking, and covered by a relatively permissive license. That being said, I have no affiliation with the artist, they are not covered by the same MIT license.
