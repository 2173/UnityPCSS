# UnityPCSS
Nvidia's PCSS soft shadow algorithm implemented in Unity

Currently only works with "Directional" light sources, as it's primarily an override of the "Screen Space Shadows" shader in the graphics settings, but I'm looking into the possibility of directly overriding the actual "Shadow Library" .cginc.

This asset shall remain forever free (because enough people charge for high quality assets), but if you wish to support me, you can donate to me through PayPal: paypal.me/TheMasonX. NOTE: Please do not donate if you don't want to/can't, I'm merely offering it as an option for those who wish to support me in devoting a lot of time into an asset that I actually have no use for in my current game.
